# International Debt Statistics Analysis ðŸ’° 
This project focuses on analysis international debt data collected by The World Bank.
<p>In this notebook, we took a look at debt owed by countries across the globe. We extracted a few summary statistics from the data and unraveled some interesting facts and figures. We also validated our findings to make sure the investigations are correct.</p>
